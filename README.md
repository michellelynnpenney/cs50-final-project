#### Description:
This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to:

- View inspirational quotes filtered by themes
- Submit their own quotes via a form
- Store and retrieve quotes using a SQLite database
- Enjoy a polished, interactive experience with animations and styling

This final project was a great introduction for me to full-stack development with SQL database integration. It was the perfect way to wrap my experience with CS50 and showcase my new engineering skillset as a Product Designer.
